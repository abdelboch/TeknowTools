Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) version 4 is no longer supported and many security professionals strongly recommend that it be uninstalled.  There  are a [number of versions](<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/269238/list-of-microsoft-xml-parser-msxml-versions>), so tracking them down and uninstalling each is no fun.

This script should find and remove (with logging) any installations of MSXML 4.

Hope it helps someone.
